# Low-dimensional cognitive maps and grid-like coding in the developing hippocampus
* aka moshiGO

## Repo description:
This repository details analyses reported in *Hippocampal development enhances spatial memory precision and generalization* ([preprint]()).

Markdown files detail three primary sections:
1) PCA-based identification of low-dimensional cognitive maps in hippocampus ([pca analysis protocol]())
2) Multivariate signatures of grid-like coding in entorhinal cortex ([grid analysis protocol]())
3) Age- and run-level differences in memory performance on spatial navigation task ([behavior analysis protocol]())

### Project description:

While adults form detailed representations of locations and landmarks in their environments, children form more limited spatial knowledge which is less detailed and less flexible in new environments.
