# Low-dimensional cognitive maps and grid-like coding in the developing hippocampus
* aka moshiGO

## Repo description:
This repository details three primary sets of analyses reported in *Hippocampal development enhances spatial memory precision and generalization* ([preprint]()).

Markdown files detail three primary sections:
1) PCA-based identification of low-dimensional cognitive maps in hippocampus ([pca analyses](https://github.com/owenfriend24/moshigo_model/blob/main/README_pca_analyses.md))
2) Multivariate signatures of grid-like coding in entorhinal cortex ([grid analyses]())
3) Age- and run-level differences in representational similarity and memory performance on spatial navigation task ([behavior and rsa analyses](https://github.com/owenfriend24/moshigo_model/blob/main/R_mds/full_maintext_results.md))

### Project description:

While adults form detailed representations of locations and landmarks in their environments, children form more limited spatial knowledge which is less detailed and less flexible in new environments. The present study directly tests the neural representations underlying these behavioral differences, capturing neural activity via fMRI while children and adults complete a dynamic spatial memory task which requires the flexible extension of spatial knowledge to new experiences. A primary finding of this study revealed that adults and high-performing adolescents form compressed cognitive maps which progressively represent Euclidean distances between items as they are learned (pictured below). In addition, we demonstrate that children rely on more discrete, rigid representational formats afforded by grid-like coding in entorhinal cortex which inhibits precision in the face of environmental change. Using an unsupervised PCA approach to capture dimensionality reduction and multivariate pattern analyses to capture grid-like coding, we reveal fundamental differences in the neural representation of spatial memories across development.
