## Repo description:
This repository details analyses reported in *Hippocampal development enhances spatial memory precision and generalization* ([preprint]()).

Markdown files detail three primary sections:
1) PCA-based identification of low-dimensional cognitive maps in hippocampus ([pca analysis protocol]())
2) Multivariate signatures of grid-like coding in entorhinal cortex ([grid analysis protocol]())
3) Age- and run-level differences in memory performance on spatial navigation task ([behavior analysis protocol]())

### Project description:

While adults form detailed representations of locations and landmarks in their environments, children form more limited spatial knowledge which is less detailed and less flexible in new environments. The present study directly tests the neural representations underlying these behavioral differences, capturing neural activity via fMRI while children and adults complete a dynamic spatial memory task which requires the flexible extension of spatial knowledge to new experiences. A primary finding of this study revealed that adults and high-performing adolescents form compressed cognitive maps which progressively represent Euclidean distances between items as they are learned. In addition, we demonstrate that children rely on more discrete, rigid representational formats afforded by grid-like coding in entorhinal cortex which inhibits precision in the face of environmental change. Using an unsupervised PCA approach to capture dimensionality reduction and multivariate pattern analyses to capture grid-like coding, we reveal fundamental differences in the neural representation of spatial memories across development.
